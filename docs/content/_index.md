Extracting heterogeneous references from texts, in particular from historical documents and humanities or legal scholarship is an unresolved problem. Yet, there is currently no coordinated effort to develop solutions.

In response to this state of affairs, we want to assemble scholars and practitioners from the social sciences, the humanities and the informational and computational disciplines to establish the state of the art, share resources and approaches and find ways for jointly developing new tools and workflows which are able to unlock previously untapped reference/citation data in the humanities, law and the social sciences.

## Workshop 2023

Our first hybrid workshop was held in May 2023 at the [Max Planck Institute for Legal History and Legal Theory (mpilhlt)](https://www.lhlt.mpg.de/en/), Frankfurt/Main, Germany. Video recordings are [available at TIB AV-Portal](https://av.tib.eu/series/1812). See the [programme](./workshop-2023/programme) for more details.

## Workshop 2025

Following the success of our 2023 workshop, we are organizing a second hybrid workshop on **Reference Extraction at the Intersection of AI Research and the Digital Humanities: Validation, Interoperability and Collaboration** on **04 November 2025** at the [Max Planck Institute for Legal History and Legal Theory (mpilhlt)](https://www.lhlt.mpg.de/en/), Frankfurt/Main, Germany.

The 2025 workshop focuses on three key themes:
- **Validation**: Evaluating and benchmarking reference extraction tools and LLMs
- **Interoperability**: Shared data models and formats
- **Collaboration**: Building partnerships across institutions and disciplines

See the [programme](./workshop-2025/programme) for details and [register here](./workshop-2025/register).
