## Workshop Title

**Reference Extraction at the Intersection of AI Research and the Digital Humanities: Validation, Interoperability and Collaboration**

## Summary

Following the success of the 2023 workshop, we continue to address the challenge of extracting heterogeneous references from texts, particularly from historical documents and humanities or legal scholarship. This second workshop focuses on three key themes emerging from the 2023 discussions:

1. **Validation**: How can we evaluate and benchmark the performance of different reference extraction tools and approaches, particularly with large language models?
2. **Interoperability**: How can we ensure that different tools, datasets, and workflows can work together effectively through shared data models and formats?
3. **Collaboration**: How can researchers, developers, and institutions work together to advance the field of reference extraction?

The workshop brings together scholars and practitioners from the social sciences, the humanities and the informational and computational disciplines to share research findings, discuss infrastructure challenges, and explore new tools and workflows.

## Workshop Structure

The 2025 workshop is organized into three thematic sessions:

1. Research presentations
2. Datasets, Infrastructure and Interoperability
3. Tools, Workflows and Pipelines

## Registration
