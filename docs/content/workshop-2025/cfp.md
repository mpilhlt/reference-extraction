## Workshop Title

**Reference Extraction at the Intersection of AI Research and the Digital Humanities: Validation, Interoperability and Collaboration**

## Summary

Following the success of the 2023 workshop, we continue to address the challenge of extracting heterogeneous references from texts, particularly from historical documents and humanities or legal scholarship. This second workshop focuses on three key themes emerging from the 2023 discussions:

1. **Validation**: How can we evaluate and benchmark the performance of different reference extraction tools and approaches, particularly with large language models?
2. **Interoperability**: How can we ensure that different tools, datasets, and workflows can work together effectively through shared data models and formats?
3. **Collaboration**: How can researchers, developers, and institutions work together to advance the field of reference extraction?

The workshop brings together scholars and practitioners from the social sciences, the humanities and the informational and computational disciplines to share research findings, discuss infrastructure challenges, and explore new tools and workflows.

## Workshop Structure

The 2025 workshop is organized into four thematic sessions:

### I. Onboarding
Recap of RefExtract2023 and state of current discussions

### II. Research
Presentations on cutting-edge research in citation analysis, benchmarking LLMs for reference extraction, and the evolution of scientific ideas

### III. Datasets, Infrastructure and Interoperability
Focus on citation extraction pipelines, datasets, open citation data, and interoperability challenges including an open roundtable discussion on data models and formats

### IV. Tools, Workflows and Pipelines
Presentations on LLM-based knowledge graph extraction, training Grobid models, and annotation tools for machine learning
